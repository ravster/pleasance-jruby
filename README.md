# Pleasance-jruby

This is a port of https://github.com/ravster/pleasance from Common Lisp to Jruby since I'd like to take advantage of the JVM's parallelization capabilities.  I could use ABCL for that instead.  Or I could just port this over to Clojure.  But I would like to do this in Ruby since its a more popular language.  I also want to see how well I can transfer this functionality over without using macros as crutches and do this in a more proper OOP style.  And I have a thing for Jruby, so there.

Also, I've gotten to work with Rails a lot recently and I don't want to build a web interface to this program in the future in CL or clojure.  I've been there, and it wasn't pretty back then.
